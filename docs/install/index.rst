Installation
============

For those experienced with installing and using Python packages, you can find
brief installation instructions in the `README`_. The installation instructions
found here are aimed at beginner users. First, we will install a programming
language called `Python`_. Next, we will install dmtools, a Python package.
The last section is optional and a little more intensive. It walks through the
installation of a program called `FFmpeg`_ which is required if you wish to
create videos with dmtools.
